# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my repos out. I hope you find something useful.

I'm a primarily PHP developer, but I know JavaScript and can write a bash script or two when needed.

Croatian-based, like to work with WordPress and Laravel. I've also done some Symfony training, so if you give me a Symfony project to work on, I won't be lost ðŸ˜„.

In my spare time I like to write tutorials and things I think about on my [personal blog](https://madebydenis.com).

I also have a [mastodon](https://phpc.social/@made_by_denis) account that I plan on using for more PHP/Programming related topics.

## Projects I like to help out

- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)
- [WPThemeReview Coding Standards](https://github.com/WPTT/WPThemeReview)
- [Eightshift development kit](https://infinum.github.io/eightshift-docs/)

## What I've worked on in the past

I've worked as a WordPress Engineer at [Infinum](https://infinum.com) where I helped establish their WordPress team and the practices within the team (setting up coding standards and best practices, writing a handbook, managing a team, hiring, etc.).
I still work on some of their open-source projects in my spare time ðŸ™‚
I was a team representative at wordpress.org's Themes Team a few years back. I mostly worked on automated tools and established some processes within the team with the rest of the team reps.

## What do I do now?

Most of my working hours these days are spent on client work.

On the personal projects side, which I'd like to work on more (but don't because I value my work-life balance), is tinkering with parsing MJML with PHP. It's fun ðŸ˜…

If you have a backend-heavy project you need help with, feel free to contact me. Also, if you'd like to sponsor me to work on the above-mentioned open-source projects, I'd be thrilled ðŸ˜„

I also created and maintain the [WordPress integration tests with PestPHP
](https://github.com/dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup/) package. Super proud of that one ðŸ™‚
