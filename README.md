# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my repos out. I hope you find something useful.

I'm a primarily PHP developer, but I know JavaScript, and can write a bash script or two when needed.

Croatian based, like to work with WordPress and Laravel. I've also done some Symfony training, so if you give me a Symfony project to work on, I won't be lost ðŸ˜„.

In my spare time I like to write tutorials and things I think about on my [personal blog](https://madebydenis.com).

You can also find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/made_by_denis) where I'll either rant about the state of my country (wich is poor atm), or share something about programming that I find out (and I find interesting).

## Projects I like to help out

- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)
- [WPThemeReview Coding Standards](https://github.com/WPTT/WPThemeReview)
- [Eightshift development kit](https://infinum.github.io/eightshift-docs/)

## What I've worked on in the past

I've worked as a WordPress Engineer at [Infinum](https://infinum.com) where I helped establish their WordPress team and the practices within the team (seting up coding standards and best practices, writing handbook, managing team, hiring, etc.).
I still work on some of their open source projects in my spare time ðŸ™‚
I was a team representative at wordpress.org's Themes Team few years back. I mostly worked on automated tools and establising some processes within the team with the rest of the team reps.

## What I do now?

I mostly work on client projects. If you have a backend heavy project you need help with, feel free to contact me. Also if you'd like to sponsor me to work on the above mentioned open source projects, I'd be thrilled ðŸ˜„

I also created and maintain the [WordPress integration tests with PestPHP
](https://github.com/dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup/) package. Super proud of that one ðŸ™‚
